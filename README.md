# Dataset-for-ENSO-shapes-salinity-regimes-and-fish-migration-in-the-China-Seas-
This is the source data for figures in "ENSO shapes salinity regimes and fish migration in the China Seas"

All the data can be read and plotted using software such as MATLAB, while the rights to interpret and own the data remain with the Ocean Carbon Group at Xiamen University. For any usage-related issues, please contact gzhwang@xmu.edu.cn or wangzhixuan@ust.hk.

For data in Wang_SourceData_Fig1.mat, X and Y are the longitude and latitude of each grid center for SSS; sal_jc is the SSS in four seasons; Sal_y is the average SSS, SMAXY is the S_MAX index, SMINY is the S_MIN index, and SCY is the SC index.

For data in Wang_SourceData_Fig2.mat, accd is the ACCD; ema1-3 are the first three leading modes; ep_y is the E-P flux; kie_y and kis_y are the Kuroshio intrusion velocity into the East China Sea and South China Sea; ninoy is the Nino 3.4 index; pcy_1-3 are the PCs of the first three leading modes; rd_y is the river discharge; s_ay is the average SSS; s_maxay is the annual mean high (SSS ≥ 34) SSS; s_minay is the annual mean low (SSS ≤ 30) SSS; s_stdy is the intra-annual SSS variability; sum_pc is the sum of PCs of the first three leading modes. 

For data in Wang_SourceData_Fig3.mat, EP_EL is the E-P flux anomaly in El Nino years; HGT_EL is the HGT anomaly in El Nino years; nino_diff is the Nino 3.4 index from 39 CMIP6 models; SAL_EL is the SAL anomaly in El Nino years. 

For data in Wang_SourceData_Fig5.mat, lat_avg is the latitude of the average SSS (s_avg_d), lat_max is the latitude of high SSS (s_max_d), lat_min is the latitude of low sss (s_min_d), lat_std is the latitude of intra-annual SSS variability (s_std_d). s_avg_a stands for zonal mean SSS data, s_max_a stands for zonal mean high SSS data, s_min_a stands for zonal mean low SSS data, s_std_a stands for zonal mean intra-annual SSS variability;

For data in F6.mat, cent_move stands for centroid shifts of individual species during El Niño years; richness stands for fish richness data; rc_rate stands for changes in species richness during El Niño years relative to climatological baselines; XXX_dr stands for the averaged data of XXX variable; XXX_std stands for 1 σ of XXX variable;

For data in Extend_F_4, rc_el_diff stands for the Habitat-suitability anomalies for 31 species during El Niño events
